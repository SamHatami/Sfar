## Core Concept
A space-based mechorganic simulator centered around a massive spherical space station (the "Sfär") that operates as an autonomous entity. The Sfär is mechorganic - a mechanical structure with organic behaviors and growth patterns.

The Sfär is not directly controlled. Instead, it responds to environmental stimuli and conditions. Players can influence it through inputs and outputs, but the Sfär decides when and how to grow based on its internal state.

## Sfär Growth Mechanics

### Autonomous Breathing Cycle
The Sfär naturally pulses in growth cycles driven by its internal state:
- **Energy Surplus → Heat Buildup → Internal Pressure → Thermal Expansion**
- **Core strengthens → Shield expands outward → New module slots appear**
- **Without structural support → Pressure equalizes → Contracts back to original size**

### Growth Stabilization
- **Scaffolding** acts as a structural "ratchet" that can lock expanded states
- Must be built during expansion phase to capture growth permanently
- Without scaffolding, all growth is temporary

### Equilibrium State
Initial goal is achieving stable equilibrium where the Sfär can self-sustain and grow naturally. Growth spurts happen more frequently when small, less frequently as size increases.

## The Sfär Entity

### Core Physical Properties
- **Internal Temperature**: Heat buildup from energy surplus
- **Internal Pressure**: Physical stress driving expansion
- **Power Generation**: Fusion core capacity (increases with growth spurts and modules)
- **Power Consumption**: Shield maintenance + module consumption (per time step)
- **Structural Integrity**: Affected by size and scaffolding support

### Modular Architecture
The Sfär consists of interlocking modules that create different behaviors affecting core growth:
- **Size**: Physical space requirements
- **Mass**: Affects station gravity and dynamics
- **Power Consumption**: Energy drain per time step
- **Function**: Specialized behaviors (energy generation, resource processing, etc.)

## Energy Systems

### Fusion Core
- **Power Generation**: Primary energy source, capacity increases through growth
- **Shield Generation**: Maintains protective barrier around station
- **Heat Production**: Excess energy creates thermal pressure driving growth

### Energy Sources
- **Solar Energy**: Space-deployed panels collected by automated drones
- **Battery Modules**: Store raw energy for core fuel
- **Secondary Cores**: Advanced fusion systems for major expansion (late development)

### Power Balance
- **Positive Net Power**: Enables growth conditions (heat buildup)
- **Equilibrium**: Stable state, minimal growth activity
- **Deficit**: System stress, potential shutdown risk

## Sfär Spatial Architecture

### Spherical Construction
- **Layer-Based**: Built in concentric spherical layers around core
- **Radial Modules**: Rectangular modules extending outward from center
- **Scaffolding**: Structural framework enabling permanent expansion
- **Shield Boundary**: Protective barrier defining current Sfär size

### Space Management
- **Dynamic Capacity**: Sfär size determines available module slots
- **Growth Spurts**: Temporarily expand available space
- **Structural Locking**: Scaffolding makes expansions permanent

### Interstitial Systems
Gaps between modules serve critical functions:
- **Structural Support**: Scaffolding and reinforcement
- **Resource Transport**: Material and energy distribution
- **Drone Corridors**: Automated system access

## Mining & Resource Extraction

### Resource Acquisition
- **Mining Vessels**: Deploy to target celestial bodies
- **Outpost Establishment**: Time-based deployment and spin-up
- **Automated Transport**: Cargo ships return materials to Sfär
- **Processing**: Raw materials converted to components and fuel

### Integration with Sfär
- **Resource Input**: Materials feed Sfär growth and module construction
- **Energy Conversion**: Raw materials processed into core fuel
- **Organic Response**: Sfär reacts to resource availability

## Galaxy & Resource Systems

### Procedural Universe
- **100,000+ celestial bodies** available for resource extraction
- **All objects harvestable** (technology permitting)
- **Dynamic resource distribution** affecting Sfär growth patterns

### Material Types
- **Primary Resources**: Iron, Copper (base materials)
- **Energy Materials**: Fusion fuel components
- **Structural Materials**: Scaffolding and module construction
- **Complex Compounds**: Advanced module requirements

## Sfär Chemical/Mechanical Process System

### Organic Processing
The Sfär operates as a complex chemical processing facility:
- **Compound Memory**: Full component history retained in all materials
- **Selective Extraction**: Multiple separation methods yield different variants
- **Emergent Chemistry**: Unexpected reactions from complex combinations
- **Core Integration**: Processed compounds affect fusion core behavior

### Module Interaction
- **Generational Effects**: Modules create compounds affecting core properties
- **Combination Behaviors**: Module mixing produces varied outcomes
- **Process Chains**: Multi-step transformation sequences
- **Environmental Factors**: Temperature, pressure, catalysts affect reactions

## Stimuli System

### Growth Triggers
Beyond basic energy surplus, specific stimuli can alter Sfär behavior:
- **Environmental Changes**: External conditions affecting growth patterns
- **Resource Composition**: Different materials triggering different responses
- **Chemical Compounds**: Processed materials influencing core behavior
- **Structural Stress**: Size-related factors modifying growth frequency

### Behavioral Modification
Stimuli can change:
- **Growth Frequency**: How often expansion attempts occur
- **Expansion Magnitude**: Size of growth spurts
- **Energy Thresholds**: Conditions required for growth
- **Core Sensitivity**: Response to internal pressure changes

---

**Development Priority**: Establish stable equilibrium state where Sfär can self-sustain basic growth cycles, then implement stimuli system for behavioral modification.
